// Visualization Plans/Ideas:
// 3D Scatter Plot (3d representation of planets discovered, ordered by which facilities discovered them)
// Standard Scatter Plot (Show Discoveries Over Time)
// Space Kit library usage (Each of us picks a planet, we can add those into the list of planets you can view)
